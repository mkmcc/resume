\mysection{Key Research Accomplishments}
%
\vspace*{\baselineskip}
%
Most of my academic research has focused on galaxy clusters, which are
the largest and most recent structures to form in the universe.  For
more information and visuals, visit my website:
\href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/index.html}{mkmcc.github.io/research}

\begin{outerlist}
  \item Showed that clouds of cold gas can condense like rain in the
    hot atmospheres of galaxy clusters; this process fuels the growth
    of galaxies in clusters and determines the maximum mass of
    galaxies in the universe.  My research overturned a paradigm about
    thermal instability which had been in place for more than 20
    years. (read more \href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/#sec:ti}{here}.)
  \item Discovered that gas in galaxy clusters may be vigorously
    ``boiling,'' contrary to what had been found in previous studies.
    This result influences how x-ray telescopes infer the masses of clusters,
    which are then used to determine quantities such as the age of the
    universe.  (read more
    \href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/#sec:mti}{here}.)
  \item Showed that the unexplained range of temperatures inside
    galaxy clusters is in fact determined by variations in their
    formation histories. (read more \href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/#sec:outer-parts}{here}.)
  \item Showed that clouds of cold gas in the center of the Milky Way
    Galaxy may survive longer than had previously been thought.
    Outlined a method for using these clouds to study the unknown
    physics of gas falling into the super-massive black hole in our
    galactic center. (read more
    \href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/#sec:g2}{here}.)
  \item Showed that the bizarre and unexpected orbits of Pluto-like
    objects in our Solar System may indicate the presence of a second
    Kuiper belt --- this is a prediction which should be tested soon!
    (read more
    \href{http://mkmcc.github.io/research/index.html#sec:plutos}{here}).
  \item Showed that the cold gas recently discovered in the outskirts
    of galaxies is in fact a ``fog'' of tiny, dispersed chunks of gas
    rather than a contiguous, solid object.  Discovered a new
    hydrodynamic instability which explains why this should be the
    case, simultaneously explaining a number of observational puzzles
    in studies of galaxies.
